# 📧 Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

This project is part of my internship with *Data Zenix. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an email message is **spam* or *ham* (not spam) based on its text content.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Spam emails are a common problem. They often contain unwanted advertisements, scams, or phishing links. In this project, I trained a model to classify emails using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning.
